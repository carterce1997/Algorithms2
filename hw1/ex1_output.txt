Contradiction: 2 -> -2 and -2 -> 2

Proof:
We will show that 2 -> -2.
By (-2, 32) on line 1732, 2 -> 32.
By (103, -32) on line 757, 32 -> 103.
By (-103, 9) on line 2879, 103 -> 9.
By (-9, -2) on line 1898, 9 -> -2.

So 2 -> -2. We will now show that -2 -> 2.
By (141, 2) on line 4710, -2 -> 141.
By (-443, -141) on line 3885, 141 -> -443.
By (443, 2) on line 830, -443 -> 2.

Therefore, the circuit is unsatisfiable.
